# Deployments
- Deployments are used to tell k8s how to create/modify instances of pods that hold containerized applications
	- scale replica pods
	- roll out updates
	- roll back to previous versions
- recommended to use Deployments instead of ReplicaSets

- **Rolling Update**
	- edit the deployment YML and then run:
		- `kubectl apply -f <deployment-name>`
		- `kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>`
	- check on update rollout by:
		- `kubectl rollout status deployment <deployment-name`
	- undo a rollout update:
		- `kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment-name>`
		- to rollback to specific version, add:
			- `--to-revision=<revision number>`
	- check rollout history:
		- `kubectl rollout history deployment <deployment-name>`
		- to get more details, add:
			- `--revision=<revision number>` 
	- Pause and resume deployment:
		- pause : `kubectl rollout pause deployment <deployment-name>`
		- resume: `kubectl rollout resume deployment <deployment-name>`
