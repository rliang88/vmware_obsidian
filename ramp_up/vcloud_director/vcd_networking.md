# VCD Networking
- Don't need to be super experienced with networking, but here are some basic concepts
## External Network Types
- Direct and Routed Network
	- Routed = provides controlled access to external networks/machines through edge gateway
		- edge gateway = proxy for a direct network
	- Direct = idk, just direct???
## VCD Networking
- **External Networks** = OVDCs use these to connect to the outside
	- only System Admin (Provider) can create and manage external networks
- **OVDC Networks** = Allows vApps within same OVDC to communicate with each other
- **vApp Networks** = allow VMs withn vApp to communicate with each other
